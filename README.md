# Using Neural Networks and Acoustic Waves to Touch-Enable Elastic Mediums

## Project Overview
**Title**: Using Neural Networks and Acoustic Waves to Touch-Enable Elastic Mediums  
**Thesis Date**: Spring 2024  
**Collaboration**: SINTEF Digital  
**Objective**: Enable touch interaction on an elastic medium using acoustic waves and neural networks.  
**Outcome**: While the desired accuracy wasn't achieved, insights into wave propagation through Generalized Cross-Correlation with Phase Transform (GCC-PHAT) were gained.
