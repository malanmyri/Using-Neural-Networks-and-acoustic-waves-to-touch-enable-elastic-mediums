# Using-Neural-Networks-and-acoustic-waves-to-touch-enable-elastic-mediums
 This repository contains a Masterâ€™s Thesis from spring 2024, completed in collaboration with SINTEF Digital. The project aimed to enable touch interaction on an elastic medium using acoustic waves and neural networks. While the desired accuracy wasn't achieved, valuable insights into wave propagation via GCC-PHAT were gained.
